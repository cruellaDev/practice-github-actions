# This example workflow prints “Hello world”, followed by “Step 1…”, “Step 2…”, “Step 3…”, and finally “Goodbye”.

# Controls when the workflow will run
# We must specify what events trigger the workflow to run.
on:
  # In this case we run it every time someone pushes to the repo.
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  # pull_request:
  #   branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
